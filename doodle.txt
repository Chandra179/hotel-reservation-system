guest can have many reservation
a single reservation can only have one room

example:
1. reservation(1, room_a, 12/12/2000, 14/12/2000)
2. reservation(2, room_a, 13/12/2000, 19/12/2000)
3. reservation(3, room_a, 01/01/2001, 07/01/2001)

a new customer want to reserve at 15/12/200 - 17/12/2000 which cannot because
there are already a reservation that checkout at 19/12/2000. Create the logic in java to
check room availability with this param (room_id, checkin date, checkout date)
